# Terms of Service (My Summary)

Stimulus.com is a growing social media community. I'll summarize their terms of service here, but you really need to read their entire text before you decide to do anything other than interact with the site as a normal user.

> **NOTE:** This project is not endorsed by Stimulus.com, its affiliate companies, or their employees and representatives. This is a hobby project, created by one of the Stimulus.com users, [@groundh0g](https://www.stimulus.com/groundh0g).

StimDeck is open-source software, provided to the public under the MIT license. In a nutshell, that means you can do what you want with the code. Tweak it. Sell it. Use it for whatever you want. I will ask that you not be a goober, though. There's a lot more to the rules of conduct, but my focus on the restrictions is that **you can't do things to interfere with the normal operation of the site, or anything to negatively impact its users**.

## The Legalese

The full description of the binding rules and regulations can be found at the following link. If you're not willing to be a user of the platform under those terms, you shouldn't be using this software.
