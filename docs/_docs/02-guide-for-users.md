This is the user documentation for the StimDeck application.

StimDeck is a heads up display (HUD) for the [Stimulus.com](https://stimulus.com/) social media site. If you've ever used the [HUD for the blue-bird site](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), then you already know how things work. If you need a little more guidance, keep reading.

> <strong><i class="fas fa-solid fa-pencil-alt"></i> NOTE: </strong> StimDeck is the unofficial HUD for Simulus.com. This project **is not** affiliated with or endorsed by Sticker Mule, Stimulus, their subsidiaries, employees, associates, vendors, families, or pets. It's a simple app created by one of their users.

## Getting Started

StimDeck installs and runs like most every application.

### Installing the App

Getting StimDeck up and running is really easy.

1. [Download the application]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/downloads/) for your operating system (OS).
1. Install the application.
1. Run the application.

That's pretty much it. If you want more detailed instructions, though, they are available for [Windows](#), [MacOS](#), and [Linux](#).

### Running the App

You can run this application as you would any other.

1. Navigate to your installed applications.
1. Double-click the application icon for StimDeck.

## Frequetly Asked Questions

I can't anticipate every query that you'll have, but the following are the questions I might ask if I were a typical user.

### Authentication and Logins

- **Do I need to login to use StimDeck?**<br/>
  Nope. At the time of this writing, Stimulus exposes most of its functionality to unauthenticated (anonymous) users.
- **What can I do without logging in?**<br/>
  At the time of this writing, Stimulus exposes the following functionality to unauthenticated (anonymous) users:
  - View the [Explore feed](https://www.stimulus.com/explore).
  - View posts.
  - View replies to posts.
  - View active giveaways.
  - View posts filtered by [a #hashtag](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=%23fauxcabulary).
  - View posts filtered by [a keyword](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=artists).
  - View posts filtered by [a specific user](https://www.stimulus.com/groundh0g).
- **When do I need to login?**<br/>
  Whenever you take actions that require authentication, you will be prompted to login. If you do not have an account, you can use this same prompt to create one. Once authenticated, additional actions include:
  - Like a post.
  - Reply to a post.
  - Restim a post.
  - Enter a giveaway.
  - Follow other users.
  - View your notifications.
  - View your "Home" feed.
- **How does StimDeck log me into Stimulus?**<br/>
  StimDeck never has access to your login credentials. Each column of the HUD is basically a mobile-friendly view of the site. When you login within StimDeck, you're actually logging directly into the Stimulus.com website.
- **Can I use multiple accounts?**<br/>
  Nope. Every column of the Simulus site is using the same credentials. You can use the application anonymously, or logged into a single account. Support for multiple accounts may be possible once Stimulus offers an API for developers.
- **How do I logout?**<br/>
  Each column in StimDeck behaves just like a browser on a mobile device. So, to logout of the site, click your avatar at the top of the column, scroll down the resulting menu until you see "Log out", then tap it.

### General Usage

- **How many columns can I open at once?**<br/>
  I haven't tested the limits of the application or the site's tolerance for multiple streams. In general, you'll see better performance if you keep the column count under 10 or so.<br/><br/>
  Behind the scenes, you're viewing the site from as many browsers as you have columns. I don't think the load on the Stimulus servers will be that great, but the resource usage on your machine will be increased with each new column. I don't believe performance will be an issue there either, though. YMMV.

### Privacy

- **Does StimDeck monitor my activities on Stimulus.com?**<br/>
  Nope. StimDeck does not track the actions of its users. Read the [privacy policy](https://www.stimulus.com/resources/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://www.stimulus.com/resources/tos) for more information on how Stimulus.com uses your personal information.

### Community

- **What is the Stimulus community like?**<br/>
  As in real life, they have a range of personalities. There are many talented creators. There are plenty of folks who are only there to win something.<br/><br/>
  Before Stimulus instated a referral program in January of 2023, it had a cozy, comfortable feel at just under 20,000 users. The referral program opened the platform to hordes of spammers.<br/><br/>
  Stimulus took (and is taking) quick action to make the feeds cleaner. They're possibly the only social site to focus so much on anti-spam measures. The 2023 invasion led to another innovation for the site &mdash; a mute button.
- **Are there any hashtags that you'd suggest?**<br/>
  Hashtags were an early feature of the site, but they're not as widely used as on the blue-bird site. Some of my favorites are:
  - [#dailystim](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=%23dailystim&tab=stims) &mdash; general topics on analog and digital life
  - [#fauxcabulary](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=%23fauxcabulary&tab=stims) &mdash; terrible puns and wordplay by yours truly
  - [#drawing](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=%23drawing&tab=stims) &mdash; art from creators
  - [#writing](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=%23writing&tab=stims) &mdash; text and prose from creators
  - [#gamedev](https://www.stimulus.com/search/keyword?q=%23gamedev&tab=stims) &mdash; game programming stims from creators
- **Are there any people that I should follow?**<br/>
  Well, me, of course. Here's a short list from my circles:
  - [@groundh0g](https://www.stimulus.com/groundh0g) &mdash; bad puns and good tech (this is me)
  - [@annranlett](https://www.stimulus.com/annranlett) &mdash; great scratchboard art
  - [@kidmental](https://www.stimulus.com/kidmental) &mdash; rap, beatbox, and improv
  - [@kathrancisco](https://www.stimulus.com/kathrancisco) &mdash; a real knit-wit, creator
  - [@itsdania](https://www.stimulus.com/itsdania) &mdash; nature artist, nap connoisseur
  - [@themagictemple](https://www.stimulus.com/themagictemple) &mdash; creator, creator organizer 
  - [@scottbrewster](https://www.stimulus.com/scottbrewster) &mdash; Alabamian, bad at guitar 
  - [@dribee](https://www.stimulus.com/dribee) &mdash; Caribbeaner transplant, artist
- **What are the community guidelines for Stimulus?**<br/>
  I'd say just don't be a wiener, but Stimulus has a more comprehensive [Community Guidelines](https://www.stimulus.com/resources/guidelines) page. It's simple and concise.

### About the Project

- **Is StimDeck affiliated with Stimulus?**<br/>
  No. This project is not endorsed by anyone at Stimulus.com. It's a personal project by one of the fans of the site ([@groundh0g](https://www.stimulus.com/groundh0g)).
- **Why is StimDeck free?**<br/>
  Because Stimulus is free. The real value of the application is the content that it presents &mdash; and I don't own that. 
- **Does StimDeck violate the Stimulus [Terms of Service](https://www.stimulus.com/resources/tos)?**<br/>
  Technically, yes. But I asked permission from Stimulus.com before writing the application. You can [read the thread](https://www.stimulus.com/stimulus/p/8bJ7_Lv3SdCOPFoNRfYPqw) here.
- **What is the MIT license?**<br/>
  This software is provided via the MIT license. In a nutshell, you can use, distribute, modify, and even sell the app. For a more detailed explaination, see the [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) website.<br/><br/>
  In general, though, it's better for everyone if we try to keep this application up to snuff, rather than fragmenting it with multiple incarnations. I chose MIT because the license allows for others to pick up the project's maintenance if I abandon it.
