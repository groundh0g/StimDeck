This is the user documentation for the Stimdeck application.

Stimdeck is a heads up display (HUD) for the [Stimulus.com](https://stimulus.com/) social media site. If you've ever used the [HUD for the blue-bird site](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), then you already know how things work. If you need a little more guidance, keep reading.

## Getting Started

Stimdeck installs and runs like most every application.

### Installing the App

Getting Stimdeck up and running is really easy.

1. [Download the application]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/downloads/) for your operating system (OS).
1. Install the application.
1. Run the application.

That's pretty much it. If you want more detailed instructions, though, they are available for [Windows](#), [MacOS](#), and [Linux](#).

### Running the App

You can run this application as you would any other.

1. Navigate to your installed applications.
1. Double-click the application icon for Stimdeck.

  Nope. Every column of the Simulus site is using the same credentials. You can use the application anonymously, or logged into a single account. Support for multiple accounts may be possible once Stimulus offers an API for developers.
