# It's a Big World

I don't feel like I need to sell you on the StimDeck application. It's the content from the community that counts.

I'd rather tell you about [Stimulus.com](https://www.stimulus.com/ref/groundh0g), the up-and-coming social media site for the rest of us.

You can be confident that you're interacting with real people. It's not perfect, but they're investing a lot of time and effort into features like anti-spam measures.

# #2: Win Cash

Created by the folks at [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/), the main hook for [Stimulus.com](https://www.stimulus.com/ref/groundh0g) is the frequent cash giveaways. Just like, share, or reply to be enterd into random drawings that last from hours to days.

Most of the contests range from $100-$500. With the majority being at each end of that spectrum. You can even host your own giveaways.
