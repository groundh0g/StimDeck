Since [Stimulus.com](https://www.stimulus.com/ref/groundh0g) supports a light and dark mode, StimDeck will support those as well. Theming is just as easy to implement for 4 or 5 palettes as it is for 2, so StimDeck will very likely support more than just light and dark. We'll see how deep that rabbit hole goes.

And, yes. I **am** enjoying my free [Balsamic for Google Drive](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/google-drive/) trial.

> StimDeck is a heads-up display (HUD) for [Stimulus.com](https://www.stimulus.com/ref/groundh0g) that allows users to view several feeds simultaneously. Due to technical constraints, stimdeck is not a web app. It's a desktop application that pulls the site's live content into what are basically mobile-friendly, narrow columns that can be viewed side-by-side.
> 
> **NOTE:** StimDeck is the unofficial HUD for Simulus.com. This project **is not** affiliated with or endorsed by Sticker Mule, Stimulus, their subsidiaries, employees, associates, vendors, families, or pets. It's a simple app created by one of their users &mdash; [@groundh0g](https://www.stimulus.com/groundh0g).
