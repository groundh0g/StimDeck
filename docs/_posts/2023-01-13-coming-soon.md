Shortly after [Sticker Mule](https://stickermule.com/) announced their new social media site, I decided to join in and kick the tires. Social media is a saturated genre. You really need a gimmick to attract new users. Their new site was called [Stimulus.com](https://stimulus.com/) and their hooks were: verified users, no bots, and cash giveaways. I was hooked. I've yet to win any of the giveaways, but I've really enjoyed the smaller community of around 15,000 users by the beginning of 2023.

The developers have rightly decided to focus on building new features over other tasks like creating mobile apps or an API for the new platform. I missed the multi-feed site viewer that's available on the blue-bird site, though. So, I decided to make one. That was the inspiration for and the genesis of stimdeck.

StimDeck is a heads-up display (HUD) for Stimulus that allows users to view several feeds simultaneously. Due to technical constraints, stimdeck is not a web app. It's a desktop application that pulls the site's live content into what are basically mobile-frindly, narrow columns that can be viewed side-by-side.
