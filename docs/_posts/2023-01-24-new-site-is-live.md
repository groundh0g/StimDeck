It's been a while in the making, but the new site is finally live. It's built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). All the content has been drafted, save for a chunk of the [User Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/guides/user/). It's really cool to see the pipeline ([GitHub Actions / Workflows](https://github.com/groundh0g/StimDeck/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)) run with each deploy. And it's especially cool to see the responsive CSS that I threw together for the landing page working on different screens and platforms. It's starting to feel like a real project.

At this stage of the game, it's worth repeating the previous post's status and rationale for StimDeck. Of course, I couldn't resist fixing several typos while I was at quoting the post.
 
> The developers at [Stimulus.com](https://www.stimulus.com/ref/groundh0g) have rightly decided to focus on building new features over other tasks like creating mobile apps or an API for the new platform. I missed the multi-feed site viewer that's available on the blue-bird site, though. So, I decided to make one. That was the inspiration for and the genesis of StimDeck.

> StimDeck is a heads-up display (HUD) for Stimulus.com that allows users to view several feeds simultaneously. Due to technical constraints, stimdeck is not a web app. It's a desktop application that pulls the site's live content into what are basically mobile-friendly, narrow columns that can be viewed side-by-side.
